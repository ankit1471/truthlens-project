    <p>
        TruthLens is an AI-Powered Fake News Detection System developed by <strong>Ankit Pal (Roll: 42, TYCS, Div: A)</strong>. 
        In an era of rampant misinformation, this project serves as a tool to help users discern the authenticity of news articles and social media posts.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="mt-4">Project Objectives</h4>
    <p>
        The primary objective of TruthLens is to build a web-based application that automatically classifies a piece of text as either REAL or FAKE. This is achieved by leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.
